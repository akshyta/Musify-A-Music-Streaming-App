# Musify-A-Music-Streaming-App

This project involves developing a Music Streaming Application named ‘Musify’ that provides its users with a variety of songs to listen to based on their choices of mood, genre, language, artist and film. 

This Application also provides support to the artists to add their newly sung/composed songs for our users and earn. 
The filmmakers also have the option to upload all the songs of their films. 
The songs can be rated and added to a "My Favourites" list by the user. 
A user logs into the Application with LoginID and Password. 
He/she is also given the option of availing for a subscription and upgrading to premium. 
The Application also supports additional benefits like display of lyrics and image along with the song being played.

Details on the UI of each screen in the Application frontend and the SQL commands used to retrieve the data from the backend can be found in the progress document.
